# Game Ranker

A web application for ranking and discovering games.

## About
Game Ranker helps you find new games based on your preferences. It uses an inversion counting algorithm to recommend games based on your preferred genres, ratings, and release years.

The recommendation engine calculates the number of inversions between your preferences and the available games. Games are then ranked, and those with the fewest inversions are suggested to you.
